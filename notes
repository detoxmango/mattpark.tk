<Typography variant="h4">
  Adaptable and self motivated learner that's passionate about the
  latest and greatest technologies with an emphasis on security
  research/analysis and penetration testing.
  <br /><br />
  I enjoy doing ctf's in my spare time and writing scripts using either
  bash or python to simplify workflow that becomes too repetitive.
  <br /><br />
  My willingness to learn and adapt may surely be an asset to you, your
  team and your company; with time, relevant skills, right mindset and
  a chance, I believe anyone can be valuable to any company.
  <br /><br />
  I am currently open to opportunities within the cyber security
  discipline and if you feel as though my listed skills or willingness
  to learn/improve would be a great match for your company then it
  would be my utmost pleasure to hear from you.
